# Visualizing Loss Landscapes

This repository provides methods for visualizing loss landscapes to understand the optimization paths and behaviors of neural networks.

## Methods for Visualizing Loss Landscapes

### 1. Linear Interpolation
- **Description**: Visualizes how loss changes as we move from initial parameters (θ) to optimized parameters (θ*).
- **Method**: Interpolate the parameters between these two sets and plot the loss along this path.
- **Insight**: A smooth change in loss indicates stable optimization and potentially good generalization ability.

### 2. Filter-Wise Normalization
- **Description**: An extension of linear interpolation that samples the loss function in a 2D space spanned by two directions.
- **Method**: Select two directions (normalized directions) d1 and d2, then evaluate the loss functions at points θ + αd1 + βd2 where α and β are scalars.
- **Applications**: Widely used for loss visualization and provides insights into the optimization path in a 2D plane.

### 3. Hessians and EigenValues
- **Description**: Uses the geometric properties of the loss landscapes, particularly curvatures.
- **Insight**: Useful for understanding the local geometry around minima, providing detailed information on the curvature and stability of the loss landscape.
- **Problem**: Not feasible for large networks due to the high complexity of computing the full Hessian.

### 4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Description**: PCA can be used to understand the optimization structure and the overall structure.
- **Method I (Optimization Path)**: Calculate PCA on the weight matrix to get information on the most optimized directions.
- **Method II (Overall Structure)**: Find the top 2 or 3 principal components capturing the most variation in the data.
- **Limitations**: PCA captures only linear variations, while neural networks are almost always non-linear.

### 5. Other Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
- **UMAP**: Captures both local and global structures of the data and handles larger datasets.
- **Autoencoders**: Use an encoder and decoder to significantly reduce dimensionality.

## Measures to Evaluate Loss Landscapes
- **Trustworthiness**: Measures how well the low-dimensional representation preserves the neighborhood structure of the high-dimensional data.
- **Reconstruction Error**: Measures how accurately the original data can be reconstructed from the reduced dimensions, especially useful if using autoencoders.
